Figma Tokens is a plugin for Figma allowing you to define and use design tokens in Figma. You can store your design tokens in JSON, sync them with a sync provider such as GitHub and define tokens even for properties that have no native support yet in Figma, such as borderRadius or spacing. You can create color and typography tokens in a granular way by extracting atomic decisions to tokens. You can also define aliases for every token, so that you can reuse your decisions. You can define and apply spacing tokens, allowing you to set the Auto Layout properties in Figma automatically. Think of it like Styles for everything.

Is your company using Figma Tokens? Consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/six7) so we can spend time and resources on it!

# How should I use this plugin?
There's 2 ways how you could use the plugin: Only use it to create or update your Styles but not apply any tokens with it, which would allow you to use features such as atomic type decisions, aliases and theme sets for managing styles (this is really powerful in combination with Figma's Swap library feature). Or you could use the plugin to apply tokens with it, which would give you style-like functionality for things like border radius or spacings.

It's up to you what method you choose. If you choose the option to keep using Styles then the plugin will only serve as a method to update them, but you would still be using Figma Styles for apply color and text styles.

# How does applying border radius or spacing tokens work?
Whenever you apply a token to a layer, the plugin will store hidden information on that layer containing information about what token to apply for what property. Whenever your tokens change, we scan the document for any layers containing these hidden information, and update layers accordingly. For Styles, the plugin checks if there is any local style with the same name of your color or typography tokens and updates these. For files where the local styles is remote (not local to that document) the plugin has no way to apply the style currently and will apply the raw hex value. I would advise to apply styles with Figma's Style feature, not with the plugin due to exactly this reason. The plugin can still serve as a manager for styles then, allowing you to use a single source of truth.
